Q3/- What is the Serialization and deseiralization in Java

answer: Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.

        Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual java object in memory.
        this mechanism is used to persist the object.
