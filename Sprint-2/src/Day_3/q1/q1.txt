Write down some predefined Functional interfaces in the java library at least 4
interfaces, with their methods.

Since Java SE 1.8 onwards, there are many interfaces that are converted into functional interface. all these interfaces
are annotated with @Functionalinterfaces. These interfaces are as follows:-

1) Comparable: java.lang.Comparable :
                                      public int compareTo(Object obj);
2) Comparator: java.util.Comparator :
                                      public int compare(Object obj1, Object obj2);
3) Runnable: java.lang.Runnable :
                                      public void run();
4) Callable: java.util.Concurrent :
                                      public void callable();
